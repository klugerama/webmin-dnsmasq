## Module settings
By default this module presumes that the configuration file is named `dnsmasq.conf` and can be found directly under `/etc/`. If your configuration file has a different name or is in a different location by default, please [report a GitHub issue](https://github.com/klugerama/webmin-dnsmasq/issues) and include your OS, distribution & distribution version, and DNSMasq version.

In order to stop/start/restart/reload the `dnsmasq` service, this module also presumes that your system has `systemd` installed.

If DNSMasq is installed and a configuration file exists but either or both are not in the default location, click on the `module configuration` link in the message (or the gear icon above the message) to go to the module configuration, where you will be able to specify the paths for the DNSMasq executable and the configuration file (among other things). The module configuration also allows you to change the commands to start, stop, and restart the dnsmasq service, as well as the commands to cause DNSMasq to reread certain configuration files (without restarting) and to dump DNSMasq logs. See the [DNSMasq documentation](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) for further information about how those commands work.

### Webmin ACL Permissions
There are several permissions relevant to what the Webmin user is allowed do with this module. View or change these permissions in Webmin by following these steps:
1. Click on `Webmin Users` under the `Webmin` menu header
2. Click on a user name in the list `Webmin Users`
3. Click on `Available Webmin modules`
4. Click on `DNSMasq DNS & DHCP server` under `Servers`
> [!WARNING]
> Enabling the "Can change file/directory permissions?" ACL permission allows the Webmin user to add system-level permissions to any file or directory, by simply specifying (in the dnsmasq configuration) `user={username}` and the file or directory as the value for any of the options which take a path. This could potentially be a security issue if the Webmin user is not `root`. Use this option carefully and at your own risk!
# Usage
## Organization
Settings for DNSMasq are broken down into three general categories - DNS settings, DHCP settings, and BOOTP/TFTP settings. Selecting the corresponding tab will show a series of icons with more specific sections under each category.

All settings correspond to specific configuration options identified in the DNSMasq documentation. For any given option, hovering the mouse over the help icon to the right of the description will show the name of the option, a brief explanation of what it does, and how to specify parameters for that option (if any).
### Simple options
Most options are either simply enabled or disabled. Some others may have one or a few values that must be specified in order to enable them. To enable an option, click the checkbox to the left of the option and click `Save`. More than one option at a time may be enabled or disabled by checking more than one box.

For those options that require additional parameters, the form will provide some guidance as to what type of information is required before you can save.
### List options
Some options may be specified multiple times. For these, a list is presented. To add an item to the list, click the `Add *` button above or below the list. This will open a dialog, showing the corresponding values that must be specified. Added items are enabled by default.

To edit an item in the list, click on any of the values to show an edit dialog.

To enable one or more list item, click the checkbox to the left of the item and click `Enable`. More than one item at a time may be enabled or disabled by checking more than one box.

For most list values, the order is not important. However, for those configuration options for which order is important, an additional column is shown on the right-hand side showing up and down arrows. Click one of these arrows to move the corresponding item up or down, respectively. The items above or below will be reordered appropriately.
### Manual configuration file editing
Finally, you may directly edit the configuration file(s) by clicking `Edit config files` under the `DNS settings` tab.
## Errors
If any errors are found in the saved configuration, a box will show at the top of the page listing the details of the discovered issue. This contains the name of the option, the configuration file it is found in, and which line contains the offending error. If a required parameter is missing, or if there is something wrong with the specified value for that parameter, a short description will identify the issue.

To address the error, you have four options:
### 1. Fix the value
Clicking on any text in the error row will take you to the relevant settings page for that option, and (hopefully) provide you with more information regarding how to fix the problem. For list items, the appropriate edit dialog will pop up for that item.

For items that with an unrecognized parameter, clicking the text has no effect.
#### Manual editing
Alternatively, there is a button to edit the option in the file editor. Clicking "Manual Edit" to the right of the error will take to the file editor, and put the cursor on the relevant line.
#### File permissions
> [!NOTE]
> This option requires the "Can change file/directory permissions?" ACL permission to be enabled, which is disabled by default.

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling the "Can change file/directory permissions?" ACL permission allows the user to add system-level permissions to any file or directory, by simply specifying (in the dnsmasq configuration) `user={username}` and the file or directory as the value for any of the options which take a path. This could potentially be a security issue if the Webmin user is not `root`. Use this option carefully and at your own risk!

If the error is a file permissions problem and the Webmin user has the option enabled, there will be another button, "Fix Permissions". Clicking that button will add the appropriate permissions to the target file or directory.

##### Example 1:

The configuration contains:
```
conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq.d/dnsmasq.reservations.conf
user=nancy
group=dnsadmin
```
`nancy` is a member of the `dnsadmin` group.

The file listing for `/etc/dnsmasq.d/`:
```
total 28
drwxr-xr-x   2 root dnsadmin  4096 Aug 21 17:06 ./
drwxr-xr-x 141 root root     12288 Sep 14 13:35 ../
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root        70 Mar 23 21:15 dnsmasq.reservations.conf -> /mnt/shared/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.reservations.conf
-rw-r--r--   1 root root       211 Apr  3  2021 README
```
`/etc/dnsmasq.d/dnsmasq.reservations.conf` is a symbolic link that points to `/mnt/shared/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.reservations.conf`.

The file listing for `/mnt/shared/dnsmasq/`:
```
total 28
drwxrwxr-x 2 root root     4096 Sep 11 22:57 ./
drwxrwxr-x 9 root root     4096 Sep 10 13:17 ../
-rw------- 1 root dnsadmin 5252 Sep 11 22:57 dnsmasq.reservations.conf
```
The file requires - but does not have - `read` permissions for the user `nancy` and/or the group `dnsadmin`. Since `nancy` is not the file's owner but is a member of the `dnsadmin` group, the module will add the `read` permission for "group" (also for "user", but not "others").

##### Example 2:

The configuration contains:
```
dhcp-script=/usr/local/bin/dhcp_script.sh
dhcp-scriptuser=fred
```
The file listing for `/usr/local/bin/`:
```
total 4264
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Jun 18  2020 ./
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root  4096 Sep  5 13:25 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 11012 Jun 18  2020 dhcp_script.sh
```
The script requires - but does not have - `execute` permissions. Since `fred` is not the file's owner and `fred` is not a member of the `root` group, the module will add the `execute` permission for "others" (also for "user" - but not "group" - because it doesn't make sense to allow others to execute the file but not the owner).
### 2. Disable the option
To disable the option and allow DNSMasq to use the default value, ensure the checkbox to the left of the error is checked and click `Disable` under `With Selected:` below the error table. More than one error-causing option at a time may be disabled by checking more than one box.
### 4. Ignore the option
To ignore the option in the specified configuration file and allow DNSMasq to use the default value (if applicable), either click the "Ignore" button to the right of the error or ensure the checkbox to the left of the error is checked and click `Ignore` under `With Selected:` below the error table. More than one error-causing option at a time may be ignored by checking more than one box.

Ignoring the error will add the contents of that line - for that configuration file only - to an internal list of ignored values. Ignored values will not be displayed as errors in the module. If the content of an ignored line is changed in the specified configuration file, it will automatically be removed from the list of ignored values.

To "unignore" an ignored value, either click the "Unignore" button to the right of the value or ensure the checkbox to the left of the error is checked and click `Ignore` under `With Selected:` below the error table. This will remove the ignored value from the internal list of ignored values, and it will again be displayed as an error in the module.
### 5. Delete the option
To delete the option from the configuration file and allow DNSMasq to use the default value, ensure the checkbox to the left of the error is checked and click `Delete` under `With Selected:` below the error table. More than one error-causing option at a time may be deleted by checking more than one box. 

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting an option from the configuration file will delete the entire line in the file. THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE. Ensure you have adequate backups of all applicable configuration files.

## Applying changes
Click the restart icon at the top right of the module's page to restart DNSMasq. In most cases, DNSMasq must be restarted to apply configuration changes.

The exceptions to this requirement are:

* `addn-hosts` 
  * DNS settings -> Basic DNS settings -> Additional hosts file(s)
* `hostsdir`
  * DNS settings -> Basic DNS settings -> Additional hosts file directories
* `servers-file`
  * DNS settings -> Additional Configuration Files -> "Additional configuration files (only 'server' and 'rev-server')"
* `dhcp-hostsfile`
  * DHCP settings -> Basic DHCP settings
* `dhcp-optsfile`
  * DHCP settings -> Basic DHCP settings
* `dhcp-hostsdir`
  * DHCP settings -> Basic DHCP settings
* `dhcp-optsdir`
  * DHCP settings -> Basic DHCP settings
* `read-ethers`
  * DHCP settings -> Basic DHCP settings

For the above options, DNSMasq will reread the specified files and directories upon receiving a SIGHUP. In addition, it will:

* clear its cache
* reload /etc/hosts (unless `no-hosts` is enabled)
* call the DHCP lease change script for all existing DHCP leases
* reread /etc/resolv.conf (if `no-poll` is enabled)

This can be done (sending a SIGHUP to DNSMasq) in the `Service Control` page under `DNS settings` and clicking
